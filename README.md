### Interactions

These are buttons I added in that allow the user to enter Covid Mode(left button) or dim the lights(right button).

Covid for me has meant i've been trapped inside my house playing games all day. Since the beginning of lock down I purchased a ton of led lights and set them up everywhere. So for my covid mode i decided to implement the color lights just like I have. When you click on the Covid mode button the main light is dimmed to almost off and 2 red lights now appear and the intensity of these 2 lights are turned up. When turning off covid mode the red lights go away and the normal ambient light is brightened as usual.

The dim light switch just reduces the main ambient light to get a dimmer atmosphere.

The other interaction I added was turning on and off the tv. When the tv is off a black screen is displayed but when you click on the screen the text goes away and a video of Call of Duty being played is shown.
